# NOTES — staged component build

Append-only, newest at the bottom. Technical log: what was tried, what the system
actually said, and every misstep. **The missteps are the point, not an appendix.**

## 2026-07-30 — lane adopted; the blocking unknown resolved in two queries

Owner: *"This provenance and ladder project is now this lane's project. Please adopt
it and update the document and write a summary of where we are."* So
`staged_component_build` moves from "proposal awaiting a separate thread" to an owned
lane of `brochure_component_library`. `features_open/027` updated accordingly; the
standing five created here.

**Resolved the `[UNVERIFIED]` the proposal named as the first action.** The question
was whether `doc_plans` fits a component without schema change. Answer: **no, and the
obstruction is one line.**

```
doc_plans_subject_type_check  CHECK (subject_type = ANY (ARRAY[
  'tool','pipeline','experience','action','experience-pattern']))
doc_notes_subject_type_check  CHECK (subject_type = ANY (ARRAY[
  'tool','pipeline','experience','action','experience-pattern','landmine']))
```

**Neither allows `component`.** An insert fails outright. Extending it is additive and
has a **four-times precedent** — migrations `163_doc_subjects_experience.sql`,
`184_travelling_action_subjects.sql`, `218_experience_register_substrate.sql`,
`270_doc_notes_landmine_subject_type.sql`. 270 is the template and is well written:
it guards that the constraint is the shape it expects, refuses if already applied, and
is re-run safe.

**The better half, and it improves the design rather than merely unblocking it:**
`doc_notes` has a `site_id` column and `doc_plans` does not. That is exactly the split
a component needs and it was already there — a component's template is fleet-shared
(one `content_components` row serves 11 sites for `info-card-grid`), so a site-less
PLAN is *correct*, while S4–S7 are per-site facts that land in NOTES. **The PLAN is the
fleet-wide contract; the NOTES are the per-site verdicts.** No column has to be added;
only the constraint changes. Mild evidence these tables were designed for something of
this shape.

Live population when read (**re-run, do not quote**): doc_notes pipeline 362 / tool 73
/ landmine 57 / experience 56 / action 16; doc_plans experience 59 / tool 35 /
experience-pattern 24 / action 4.

**A trap spotted before it fired, worth more than the resolution.** The `doc_notes`
constraint must be re-added **with `'landmine'` kept**. Copying `doc_plans`' array
across — the obvious way to make two tables agree — would drop it and orphan **57 live
rows** written by two other threads. The two tables do not have the same constraint and
should not be assumed to. Written into the RUNBOOK beside the DDL.

**Decided NOT to create `272_*.sql` in `sql_for_agents/`**, and this is a real decision
rather than caution. The migration runner takes *every* pending file in a directory, so
an unreviewed numbered file sitting there could be applied by an unrelated session's
`--apply`. **A staged artefact another session can apply by accident is not staged, it
is armed.** The DDL lives in the RUNBOOK and gets a number when it goes to the council
gate.

## 2026-07-30 (same session) — what the review of the tools-chain report contributed

Reviewing `webdesign_tools_repair`'s rewritten report (asked for separately) produced
three things this lane now depends on, so they are recorded here rather than only in
`brochure_component_library`'s notes.

**1. A live hazard that threatens every gate in the ladder.** An unknown check type is
**skipped, not failed** — `run_checks_action.go`'s type switch ends
`default: skip(ch.ID, ch.Type+" not implemented")` — and that report's own **G4**
(verified in code) says an all-skipped result set yields `len(Failed)==0` → **PASS note
plus a 7-day cooldown**. So a gate authored against a check type the running binary
does not carry **passes vacuously and suppresses its own re-check for a week**.

For a *ladder* this is worse than for a checklist, because stage N's pass is what
licenses stage N+1. Hence PLAN D3: **a stage that cannot evaluate its question is
inconclusive, not passed.** Filed to `LANDMINES.md` (footprinted on the `default:`
skip arm) rather than as a bug, because nothing is broken — the trap is authoring
against it.

It is live right now, not hypothetical: `has_visible_area` (TL-034) was committed
07-30 15:19 (`1850acb07`) and the running `browser-runner-adapter` pod predates it. So
the newest and most useful check type for this ladder is currently **exactly the one
that would silently skip.**

**2. A method misstep of mine, caught by a control — this is the transferable part.**
My first pod-grep used the check-type names themselves: `has_visible_area` **0**, but
also `selector_count` **0** on a binary that demonstrably supports `selector_count`.
**Go compiles short string literals to immediate comparisons that never reach rodata**,
so a short marker returns 0 on a fully-supporting binary. Had I stopped at the first
result I would have reported the pod as missing a check type it has. Re-ran with long
markers unique to the change (`"too small to see or click"`,
`"A collapsed flex/grid child is the usual cause"`) against three long pre-existing
controls (`"page overflows horizontally"`, `"but a parent CLIPS it"`,
`"in the live DOM after settle"`): new **0/0**, controls **1/1/1**. *A negative from a
short marker is worthless.* Also: that image has **no `strings` binary** — use
`grep -ac` on the binary directly.

**3. Two gate-authoring rules, better stated by the other lane than by me**, adopted
into the proposal: verify through the visitor's gesture and never the subject's
internal functions (and if the vocabulary cannot express the gesture, that is a missing
check type to record as a deferral, **not** a licence to substitute a function call);
and a gate must assert the **terminal value**, not the first observable state change.

**The convergence is the strongest evidence this lane has.** That lane verified
`pasteboard` by calling `addItem()` and `logic-architect` by calling `loadTemplate()`;
both returned the right answer so both "passed", while a visitor could reach neither.
This lane forced `.open = true` on DOM nodes and called it verified for four rounds.
**Those are one defect class — verifying through a privileged path the visitor does not
have — not two similar mistakes.** Two lanes, two subject types, one day, arrived at
independently. Its generalisation is the best single line for the browser tier:
**a property of the composition can only be checked in the composition.**

**Also corrected in the proposal**, from the same review: two figures in the tools
report had drifted inside its own editing window (fence count 23 → **25**, re-run
here), which is a live demonstration of its own *"never quote a count you didn't
re-run"* rule and the reason this lane's RUNBOOK marks every figure as re-runnable.

**Not adopted, deliberately:** `features_open/015`, the site maturity ladder. The tools
lane's decomposition — **015 is the rung vocabulary, 027 is the gate mechanism, 026 is
the missing instrument** — makes the three composable rather than merged, so this lane
can proceed without owning the site-scale question. Recorded as PROPOSED; whether 015
stays a separate thread is the owner's call, not ours to take by adopting it.

## 2026-07-30 (later) — SUBMITTED to the council; and D5 was wrong, twice over

Owner: *"please carry on and take that through the council gate."* Done — correlation
**`e5673868-7c5b-489c-931a-7ba59b959b91`**, commit `c659e312b`. Budget ~30 minutes for a
verdict; the council itself takes 2–5 but the dispatch queues behind the fleet.

**Two assumptions I held at the start of this were both wrong, and checking them is the
whole content of this entry.**

**Wrong assumption 1: "the gate will refuse this, because it is a DDL file under
`docs/`."** I read the trigger script expecting a refusal —
`SCOPE_RE='^(platform|internal|pkg)/'`, and its own comment says docs never spend
council credits. I was ready to report that the honest governing path was owner approval
plus the migration guards, citing migration 270 (which was indeed applied out of band
that way). **That was wrong because my understanding of the CHANGE was incomplete, not
because the scope rule is odd.** The change genuinely touches `platform/`, so it passes
the scope check with no `FORCE`. Also worth recording: the check is
`[.plan.edits[].file | select(test($re))] | length > 0` — **any** in-scope edit qualifies,
not all.

**Wrong assumption 2 — the serious one: "the migration is the whole change."** It is
not. `subject_type` has a **second enforcement point in Go**: `validDocSubjectTypes`
(`platform/orchestration/actions/doc_subjects_common.go:37`), which gates
`write_doc_plan`, `append_doc_note`, `load_doc_context` and `persist_diagnosis_note`.
Shipping the DDL alone would have reproduced **`bugs_open/064` for the third time** —
migration 163 (+`experience`) missed the `persist_diagnosis_note` gate; migration 184
(+`action`) moved the DB CHECKs **only** and left its own seeded action docs unreachable
through every doc action. The file's own header says the rule outright: *a value the DB
accepted but a Go gate rejects, or vice versa, is a split contract; move both together.*

**My RUNBOOK, PLAN, PROPOSAL, NOTES and memory entry all described the incomplete fix**,
and every one of them is now corrected in place rather than quietly edited. This is
`WRONG_CALLS.md` material and is logged there.

**What actually caught it:** not care, and not a review — a **code comment**, which
pointed at `experience_register/design/subject_type_addition.md`, a checklist that
already enumerates all four enforcement points and was written precisely because *"every
addition so far has missed at least one"*. I found the checklist only because I opened
the file I was about to edit. **The cheap check that would have caught it: grep the
value you are adding, not the table you are changing** — `git grep -n
"experience-pattern"` returns the Go list, the migration and the checklist in one shot.

**D5 is REVERSED (→ D5′).** Beyond the Go half, the migration **must** be numbered in
`sql_for_agents/`, because `TestValidDocSubjectTypes_LockstepWithMigrationCheck` parses
the newest numbered `.sql` recreating `doc_plans_subject_type_check` and fails if its
array differs from the Go list. So withholding the number protects nothing and **reddens
HEAD** for every other session the moment the Go edit lands. D5 as written was
unbuildable. The residual risk D5 worried about (another session's `--apply` sweeping it
in early) is real but **inert here** — nothing writes component docs yet, so a widened
CHECK ahead of the image has no effect. That is stated in the migration header so nobody
over-reacts to an early apply.

**Applied this lane's own S2 rule to itself.** The lockstep test passing is not evidence;
it had to be seen red. Hid the migration → **FAIL**, naming 184's exact failure mode
(*"split contract: validDocSubjectTypes = [action component experience
experience-pattern pipeline tool] but 218_experience_register_substrate.sql sets the
CHECK to [action experience experience-pattern pipeline tool] — move both together"*);
restored → passes. `platform/...` and `internal/...` build clean; actions tests pass.

**Blast radius measured, not asserted** (07-29 ruling §3 — name the consumers and tell
them, do not merely measure). Consumers: `write_doc_plan`, `append_doc_note`,
`load_doc_context`, `persist_diagnosis_note`, `check_tool_acceptance`,
`check_tool_acceptance_due`, `rename_tool_identity`/`RekeyTravellingDocs`, and
`scripts/landmines-sync.py`. **Nothing changes for any of them.** The one consumer that
reads `doc_notes` without a `subject_type` filter is `digestGatherImmune`
(`fixloop_digest_action.go:295-299`) and it is narrowed by
`categories ? 'triage'`/`'silent-check'`, which component notes will not carry — they
mirror the tool convention (`acceptance-run`/`acceptance-fail`). So the count does not
move, and that is a query rather than an argument.

**Registered in the shipping commit** as **DOC-068** (CLAUDE.md platform-seams condition
2 — a shared-vocabulary seam must be registered in the same commit that ships it), with
its landmine and its open review question; dropped from `102_coverage_ratchet.txt`
accordingly. Index row added. Noted in passing, **not fixed**: DOC-067 is absent from
`000_concept_index.md` — another thread's omission, and tidying it silently is not mine
to do.

**Unrelated red HEAD found while building, flagged not fixed:** `cmd/reasoningset/main.go`
does not compile at HEAD (`declared and not used`, line 504) — confirmed present in
HEAD's own copy with no local modifications, so it is another lane's (reasoning_dataset).
`platform/...`, `internal/...` and every other `cmd/` build clean.
