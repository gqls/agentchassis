## 2026-07-31 — session 1, picking up the handoff

### The handoff's stated blocker had already dissolved

Handoff §1 carries an explicit `[UNMEASURED]`: *"I could not enumerate the bucket.
The `b2` CLI is present on this machine but there are no B2 credentials
(`env | grep B2_` is empty; the keys live only as GitHub Actions secrets)."* It then
makes bucket enumeration item 1 of "what I would check first".

That is no longer true. `env | grep B2_` is still empty — so **the check the handoff
used would still report "no credentials"** — but `~/.config/b2/account_info` exists
(mtime 2026-07-31 21:56 local) and `b2 account get` authorises with
`listBuckets`/`listFiles`/`readFiles`. The credentials are in the CLI's sqlite
account store, not the environment.

**Lesson, and it is the generalisable one:** an absence measured through **one**
access path is not an absence. `env | grep B2_` answers "are the keys in the
environment", which is not the question "can this machine read the bucket". The
cheap check that settles it is the tool's own auth probe — `b2 account get` — not a
grep for how you assumed the tool is configured.

Result: the whole `[UNMEASURED]` was replaced with a measurement in about ten
seconds, and the handoff's item 1 was closed.

### Bucket reconciliation — the handoff's inventory was right

`b2 ls --recursive` → 34 entries = **29 real files + 5 `.bzEmpty`** placeholders.
23 HTML (14 top-level + 9 guides), `css/style.css`, `js/calculators.js`, 2 PNG,
1 XCF, `robots.txt`. Matches handoff §2's count of 23 HTML exactly.

`gemini/02` really is the byte source of truth: 28 of 29 bucket files
sha256-identical. The two asymmetries the handoff predicted both confirmed —
`robots.txt` bucket-only, `README.md` local-only (404 live).

### MISSTEP — I nearly committed Cloudflare's edge injection into the origin

I fetched `robots.txt` over HTTPS to fill the gap in the local tree. It came back
**2,327 bytes** with `x-amz-*` headers present, which is the usual tell that a file
is served from B2 rather than synthesised by Cloudflare. The handoff had already
characterised it as *"a real origin file (substantial, WordPress-style hardening
rules), **not** Cloudflare's Managed robots.txt block"* — so both the header
evidence and the prior thread agreed.

Both were wrong, and it is a **composite**. The served file is the origin file with
a `# BEGIN Cloudflare Managed content` … `# END Cloudflare Managed Content` block
**injected at the edge**. Pulling the same object straight out of the bucket gives
**491 bytes** and `grep -c "Cloudflare Managed"` → **0**.

Had I committed the fetched copy, the origin would permanently carry a hardcoded
copy of Cloudflare's managed block, which Cloudflare would then inject *again* on
every request — a duplicated directive set in a file whose whole job is to be
parsed strictly by crawlers.

**What caught it:** printing the whole file instead of the tail. **Why the handoff
missed it:** it ran `curl … | tail -5`, and the injected block sits at the *top*,
above the origin's own rules. A tail is a fine way to confirm a file is non-empty
and a bad way to establish what a file *is*.

**The transferable check:** when bytes are the deliverable, read them from the
origin store, not through a CDN. `x-amz-*` headers prove where the object was
fetched from; they prove nothing about whether the edge rewrote the body on the way
out. The 28/28 HTML matches are the control that makes this specific rather than
paranoid — Cloudflare rewrote `robots.txt` and nothing else.

### MISSTEP — a failed dry run printed as a clean one

First dry-run attempt used `--dryRun` (b2 CLI v3 spelling). This CLI is v4.7.0, so
it exited **2** with a usage dump. My pipeline then ran
`grep -i '^delete' … || echo "(none)"` over that dump and printed:

```
=== DELETIONS the sync would perform ===
(none)
=== UPLOADS the sync would perform ===
(none)
```

Which is exactly what a perfectly safe no-op sync would print, on the run that
verifies I am not about to delete a live site.

**What caught it:** I printed `=== EXIT ${PIPESTATUS[0]} ===` in the same block and
it read 2. **The lesson is not "check exit codes"** — it is that a `grep … || echo
"(none)"` idiom *manufactures* a reassuring answer out of a failure, because zero
matches and zero output are indistinguishable to it. The check and the failure mode
produce the same characters. Any "no findings" print needs a positive control in the
same block, and for a subprocess the exit status is the cheapest one available.

### The real dry run — 29 uploads, 35 deletes, and that is fine

With `--dry-run`, exit 0:

- **29 uploads** — every file, because `b2 sync` compares mtime and freshly-staged
  copies are newer than Jan-2026 bucket objects. `--skip-newer` skips only when the
  **destination** is newer, so it does not apply. The GitHub runner's fresh
  `actions/checkout` has the same property, so this is what every domain's deploy
  already does.
- **30 deletes marked `(old version)`** — B2 version pruning, each paired with a
  re-upload of byte-identical content. `index.html (old version)` twice, so the
  bucket held two superseded versions.
- **5 `.bzEmpty` deletes** — the placeholders.
- **0 live content files deleted without replacement.**

I want to be careful about how this gets summarised later, because "the sync is a
no-op" is the tempting phrasing and it is false. The true statement is narrower:
**the sync changes no served content.** 29/29 staged files are sha256-identical to
the bucket objects they replace, and `comm -23 bucket_files staged_files` is empty,
which is the direct evidence that `--delete` removes no content.

### Decision D1 recorded, and why I am writing it down at length

The owner chose `--fidelity high` after being shown the code. `high` is not a
softer `locked`; it is the *absence* of a setting, falling through to the recreate
path — new synthesised URLs for every page, every page regenerated by an LLM. I put
the choice in front of them with `apply_adoption_plan_action.go:426` and
`082_submit_domain_unified.sh:64-66` quoted, and they took `high`. That stands.

Recording it in PLAN as D1 because in three weeks the live site will have
`/tools/repayment/index.html` where it used to have `/repayment.html`, and the
question "was that intended?" needs an answer that is not archaeology.

**One thing I have carried across from the handoff and must NOT:** handoff §5d says
assert `needs_content_page` + `needs_tool_recreation` = **0**, "if either appears,
an LLM is about to rewrite working calculators — stop." That is the **`locked`**
assertion. Under `high` those work items are the intended output. Copying that check
across would have me halt the run at its first correct step. Noted in RUNBOOK §6.

### State at end of this entry

Deploy repo populated and committed locally (29 files, pathspec-scoped). **Not
pushed** — the push triggers the live sync, so it is the owner's call. Nothing has
touched the cluster or the live site yet.
