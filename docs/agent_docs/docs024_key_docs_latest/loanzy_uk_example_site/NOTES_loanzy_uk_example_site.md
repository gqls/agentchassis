# NOTES — loanzy.uk example site

Append-only, newest at the bottom. Missteps included — they are the point.

## 2026-08-18 — session start: finding the previous thread, and what it turned out to be

Asked to find the previous loanzy.uk thread and take it on. There were **three**, none of
them a lane of its own:

1. `idea_uk_vm_site`, 2026-08-03 (owner: *"can you do loanzy.uk"*) — delegated to Cloudflare
   via Nominet EPP under the DESIGNCONSULT tag, zone active in 60s, edge cert issued. Left an
   open item: *"loanzy.uk content: needs a Worker route / B2 wiring — webdesign lane's
   machinery."*
2. `domains_cloudflare_rollout`, 2026-08-09 — the **dangling delegation**: NS pointed at
   Cloudflare, zone deleted, so requests timed out instead of failing honestly. Owner
   re-added the zone; clean 404 since. That session deliberately built nothing (HOLD domain).
3. `portfolio_positioning`, 2026-08-15 — **P9**: *"leave loanzy.uk with the webdesign team"*.

**A correction made on the way in.** `portfolio_positioning/HANDOFF_2026-08-18` §5 listed
loanzy.uk, the B8/B9/I10 holds and the build order as Phase D decisions *"unchanged and still
outstanding"*. All three had been **ruled by the owner at P9 on 08-15** — the bullet was a
stale carry-forward from `PLAN_2026-08-12`. Struck through with a dated correction
(`8229b1362`), not deleted. Cost of not catching it: that lane keeps asking the owner a
question he closed three days ago.

**The owner's memory of "a site about FCA rules built alongside loancash" was right about the
site and wrong about the domain** — it is `lendzy.co.uk`, one letter from `loanzy.uk`. Both
`loancash.co.uk` (L10, *"The Rules That Protect UK Borrowers"*) and `lendzy.co.uk`
(*"Know the Rules Before You Borrow"*) are live, 22 pages each, both redeployed 2026-08-18.
`loanzy.uk` has **0 rows in `sites`, 0 work items** and serves a 9-byte 404. Checked twice,
in two ways (DB census across `loan|lend|borrow|credit`, plus the live probe), because the
first check was a name match that could only ever have confirmed what I already believed —
the family census is the one that could have come out otherwise, and it did.

**What the decision became.** Four messages, converging: back in the finance queue → no, an
example site → which means no prior registry entry → built only from the webdesign.uk prompt.
Recorded as **P10** in the register with its consequences enumerated (`f21530d37`), because a
ruling whose *implications* live only in a chat log is one a future session will misapply.

**Why it lands where the webdesign lane is actually stuck** `[MEASURED, from their docs]`:
proposal F was approved the same day and its `writer_block` forbids naming examples until a
gallery exists, because none of the four attested example sites was built by the one-shot
route. This lane produces the first pair that would populate one.

**What the "one-shot route" is, mechanically** `[MEASURED]`: the chat box
(`box/chat-service`) is a self-contained intake bot — stdlib only, no DB driver, transcripts
to JSONL on the box. It **dispatches nothing**. So today the route is: customer's brief →
operator seeds and dispatches the standard gated pipeline. The honest constraint is therefore
about the **input**, not the button: every seeded input must trace to a sentence in the
prompt. Written into PLAN as the rule, with a requirement to log deviations here.

**Not done, deliberately**: no seed, no dispatch, no lane SUMMARY. The prompt is the owner's
and it is a published artefact — building first and asking after would produce a pair whose
prompt was reverse-engineered from the site, which is the one thing this exercise cannot
survive.
