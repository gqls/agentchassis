# NOTES — Sedo domain management (append-only, newest at the bottom)

## 2026-09-02 — lane opened (owner request: "set up sedo … so that you can manage my domains")

**Research** (web, sources in PLAN):
- API endpoint `https://api.sedo.com/api/v1/<Function>`, GET or POST,
  XML out; SOAP/WSDL also offered, not needed.
- Auth params on every call: `partnerid` (int), `signkey`, `username`
  (≤25 ch), `password` (≤16 ch — the API doc's own cap).
- Access: email api@sedo.com from the registered address; partner-programme
  registration required first; approval issues Partner ID + SignKey.
- Functions: DomainList/-Extended, DomainStatus, DomainInsert/Edit/Delete,
  DomainSearch, portfolio CRUD, parking setup/keyword/template, blacklist
  check. `results` ≤100/call, `startfrom` pages. currency 0=EUR 1=USD 2=GBP.
- Prior art: NO existing Sedo integration anywhere in the estate — repo
  grep hits were archive.org JS noise, the parking-200s landmine, and a
  stats-export aside in the traffic-probe brief.

**Measured today** (each could have come out otherwise):
- `busybox:1.36` ephemeral pod, in-cluster: pulled, resolved, TLSed to
  api.sedo.com, got `<SEDOFAULT> E7 "Partnerid doesn't exist"` on dummy
  creds. So: public image pull works, egress works, API answers, and
  **faults are in-band XML on a readable body** (the BusyBox
  4xx-body-drop limitation doesn't bite here).
- Same probe printed `wget: note: TLS certificate validation not
  implemented` → BusyBox wget REJECTED as transport for credentialed calls.
- `curlimages/curl:8.10.1` pod: pulled, POST with `--fail-with-body`, same
  E7. This is the pinned transport.
- `kubectl run -i` printed its own warning that commands+output land in
  container logs, and its attach-failure fallback double-printed the
  response → runner design changed to run → wait → logs → delete, creds
  via envFrom only.

**Missteps:**
- First cut of `PARAM_RE` used `\[\]` inside an ERE bracket expression —
  backslash does NOT escape there, so the first `]` closed the class and
  both positive self-tests failed. Fix: `[][A-Za-z0-9_.-]` (the
  `]`-first idiom). Caught by the script's own `--self-test` on first run —
  which is the argument for writing the self-test before the first use.

**Built:** `scripts/sedo-api.sh` (self-test PASS 7/7; probe PASS; secret
missing → clear pointer to RUNBOOK §3). Credentialed path UNEXERCISED —
blocked on owner obtaining the account + SignKey (RUNBOOK §1–§3).
Registered as OPP-012.
