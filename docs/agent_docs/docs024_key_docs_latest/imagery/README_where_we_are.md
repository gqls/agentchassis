● Everything is persisted (your bulk commit v1.0.1114 swept in my Turn 34 notes and the emit action; the asset-deployer sprite_css mode is live in the DB). Big progress this turn:

The sprite sheet is live and gate-passed. After all three deploy-plumbing fixes, the re-drive produced a clean 768×768 JPEG at 75,745 bytes — under the 80KB budget — serving 200. The image is exactly right (nine flat
glyphs on charcoal, correct order), you confirmed the cell meanings, and I've written cell_names_verified: true into the plan row so the CSS emitter can trust the map. Notably, the phase's headline risk — the model
putting the wrong glyph in the wrong cell — never materialised; every problem was deploy/dispatch plumbing, all now fixed and documented.

I2.2 and I2.3 are built:
- emit_sprite_css — computes the stylesheet purely from the verified grid geometry (no image cropping): a .sprite base plus per-glyph .sprite-<name> classes for inline/icon/nav use, and themed ul.sprite-list bullets
  with a default glyph and per-item li.sprite-b-<name> overrides, all scaled to bullet size. It commits /assets/css/sprites.css, and it's guarded on cell_names_verified=true so it can never emit CSS keyed to an
  unverified (possibly mislabelled) sheet. The geometry math is unit-tested.
- Head link injection — sprites.css is linked into every <head>, guarded on an active sprite sheet existing (no 404 link on sites without one).
- asset-deployer sprite_css mode (migration already live) — mirrors the brand_head pattern, making the whole thing reusable fleet-wide via a needs_sprite_css work item.

One deploy carries the emit action + head-link Go. After it, the finish line for I2 is short: dispatch the needs_sprite_css item → sprites.css commits → a site-component re-render lands the head link → I wire
class="sprite-list" onto one robot-hands section's list → live gate (readable themed bullets, one small download). Then I2.4's fulfilment discovery check closes the phase.

Flag me when you deploy and I'll run that finish sequence.
