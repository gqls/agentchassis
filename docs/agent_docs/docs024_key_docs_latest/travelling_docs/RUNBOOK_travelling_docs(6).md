# RUNBOOK — Travelling Docs (PLAN + NOTES): Tools, Complex Components, Pipelines

**Created:** 2026-07-04
**Last updated:** 2026-07-04 (rev 7 — Stage-3 fetch corrected to real agent_definitions columns; diagnosis + write-hook agent types resolved)

---

**For someone new to this runbook:** this system builds and maintains websites
with autonomous agents. Every complex tool/interactive component and every
pipeline now carries its own **travelling documentation in Postgres** — a
**PLAN** (what it is for, how it is delivered, its deliberate decisions, and
its **acceptance criteria**: the per-tool definition of *working*) and a
**NOTES** log (every fix, diagnosis, and dead end, tagged by category). Agents
write these docs as a byproduct of the steps that create and fix things, and
**load them before touching a subject**, so fixes build on prior decisions
instead of re-deriving lost context. Acceptance criteria are then checked in
tiers — from static presence checks up to driving the deployed tool in a
headless browser (desktop + mobile) — iterating until the criteria pass. This
runbook is the operating manual: where the docs live, how each write/read
happens, and (§0) the staged rollout with exactly what to run at each step and
a marker showing where we are. Design rationale: `PLAN_travelling_docs.md`;
the headless runner's own plan: `PLAN_tool_acceptance_runner.md`.

**Applies to:** tools (`content_components.component_level='tool'`),
interactive/stateful components, and pipelines. Pipeline subject keys (live,
confirmed 2026-07-04): `build`, `content`, `design`, `maintenance`.

## 0. ROLLOUT TRACKER — YOU ARE HERE

**Position as of 2026-07-04 (later same day):**
Stage 0 ✅ · Stage 1 ✅ · Stage 2 ✅ (actions ON PRODUCTION) ·
**Stage 3 ▶ YOU ARE HERE** · Stages 4–6 pending.
Optional pilot PLAN: unblocked now (see after Stage 3).

---

### Stage 0 ✅ Pre-migration gates — DONE 2026-07-04
No `doc_plans`/`doc_notes` collision; `site_work_items.pipeline` live values =
`build` (3579), `content` (24), `design` (13), `maintenance` (2); no CHECK
constraint. These four values are the valid pipeline `subject_key`s.

### Stage 1 ✅ Migration — APPLIED 2026-07-04
Statement tally verified (2 CREATE TABLE, 5 CREATE INDEX, 3 COMMENT, COMMIT).
Optional table smoke (incl. the DELIBERATE duplicate-insert error proving
`idx_doc_plans_current`, and cleanup):

```sql
INSERT INTO doc_plans (subject_type, subject_key, body, source, created_by)
VALUES ('tool','smoke-test-tool','smoke v1','human','smoke');

-- EXPECTED ERROR: duplicate key violates "idx_doc_plans_current"
INSERT INTO doc_plans (subject_type, subject_key, body, source, created_by)
VALUES ('tool','smoke-test-tool','smoke v2','human','smoke');

UPDATE doc_plans SET is_current=false, superseded_at=now()
 WHERE subject_type='tool' AND subject_key='smoke-test-tool' AND is_current;
INSERT INTO doc_plans (subject_type, subject_key, body, source, created_by)
VALUES ('tool','smoke-test-tool','smoke v2','human','smoke');

SELECT subject_key, is_current, superseded_at IS NOT NULL AS superseded, created_at
FROM doc_plans WHERE subject_key='smoke-test-tool' ORDER BY created_at;

INSERT INTO doc_notes (subject_type, subject_key, body, categories, source, created_by)
VALUES ('tool','smoke-test-tool','## 2026-07-04 — smoke','["diagnosis"]'::jsonb,'human','smoke');
SELECT subject_key, categories FROM doc_notes WHERE categories ? 'diagnosis';

DELETE FROM doc_notes WHERE subject_key='smoke-test-tool';
DELETE FROM doc_plans WHERE subject_key='smoke-test-tool';
```

### Stage 2 ✅ Go actions — ON PRODUCTION 2026-07-04
`write_doc_plan`, `append_doc_note`, `load_doc_context`,
`persist_diagnosis_note` deployed with their registry entries.

### Stage 3 ▶ YOU ARE HERE — first wiring: `persist_diagnosis_note`
Chosen first: additive, config-gated, END of an existing workflow, triggerable
on demand. **The wiring migration is drafted only against the real workflow
JSON (072 lesson: steps hide in nested sub_workflows). Do these in order:**

**3.1 — Fetch the current definitions (run and paste back).** NOTE: there is
NO `processing_mode` column; workflows live in `task_workflow` /
`orchestrator_workflow` / `orchestration_workflow` / `default_config->'workflow'`
(jsonb). The diagnosis family is `diagnose-orchestrator`, `diagnose-agent`,
`code-indexer` — `diagnose_emit` runs in one of the first two; these queries find
which agent + which column, so we patch the right place (072 rule):

```sql
-- A) which family members are real, and which workflow column each populates:
SELECT type, status,
       (task_workflow          IS NOT NULL) AS has_task_wf,
       (orchestrator_workflow  IS NOT NULL) AS has_orch_wf,
       (orchestration_workflow IS NOT NULL) AS has_orchestration_wf,
       (default_config ? 'workflow')        AS cfg_has_workflow
FROM agent_definitions
WHERE type IN ('diagnose-agent','diagnose-orchestrator','code-indexer')
  AND deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY type, version DESC;

-- B) locate the diagnose_emit step across all four possible homes:
SELECT type, version,
       (task_workflow::text          ILIKE '%diagnose_emit%') AS in_task,
       (orchestrator_workflow::text  ILIKE '%diagnose_emit%') AS in_orch,
       (orchestration_workflow::text ILIKE '%diagnose_emit%') AS in_orchestration,
       (default_config::text         ILIKE '%diagnose_emit%') AS in_cfg
FROM agent_definitions
WHERE type IN ('diagnose-agent','diagnose-orchestrator','code-indexer')
  AND deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY type, version DESC;

-- C) pretty-print the workflow that showed true in (B) and PASTE BACK:
--    replace <col> (true column), <type>, <ver> (its max version):
SELECT jsonb_pretty(<col>::jsonb)
FROM agent_definitions
WHERE type = '<type>' AND version = <ver>;
```

**3.2 — Ready-to-place step fragment** (prepared; config is EMPTY because the
action's InputSpec defaults already read emit's `diagnosis.*` output and the
`input_data.*` subject fields — set `diag_subject_type_field`/
`diag_subject_key_field` explicitly only if your diagnosis agent names them
differently). Exact step-object shape (`output_field`/`input_mapping` naming)
is confirmed from your paste before the migration is written:
```json
"persist_diagnosis_note": {
  "action": "persist_diagnosis_note",
  "config": {},
  "output_field": "diagnosis_note"
}
```
Placement: AFTER the emit step, BEFORE `complete_workflow` (so `result_from`
is unaffected).

**3.3 — Apply the drafted migration** (it targets the CURRENT version row:
`type=<type> AND version=(max) AND deleted_at IS NULL`, matching the versioned
`agent_definitions` pattern — not a blind UPDATE by `type`). Then trigger ONE
diagnosis run with an explicit subject in input (`subject_type`:
`tool`|`pipeline`, `subject_key`, e.g. `pipeline`/`build` or a known tool
function).

**3.4 — Verify (positive AND negative):**
```sql
SELECT subject_type, subject_key, categories, left(body,120) AS body_head, created_at
FROM doc_notes ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```
Expect one `diagnosis` (or `unconfirmed-diagnosis`) entry. A run WITHOUT an
explicit subject must report `persisted:false` and leave NO row.

### Pilot PLAN (optional — UNBLOCKED NOW; tables live, no wiring needed)
Seeds the first real tool PLAN by SQL, satisfies Stage 5's precondition early,
and dogfoods the format. Later `write_doc_plan` calls supersede it cleanly.

```sql
-- 1) candidates (pick one function, byte-for-byte):
SELECT function, component_level, is_active, left(description,60) AS descr
FROM content_components
WHERE component_level = 'tool'
ORDER BY function;

-- 2) seed (replace <function> throughout; body is dollar-quoted):
INSERT INTO doc_plans (subject_type, subject_key, body, source, created_by)
VALUES ('tool', '<function>', $plan$# PLAN — <function>

## Aim
<what the tool is for, in product terms>

## Source spec
<the site-spec / roadmap slice it derives from>

## Behaviour contract
<states, inputs, outputs>

## Acceptance criteria
```criteria
{ "profiles": ["desktop","mobile"],
  "checks": [
    {"id":"boots","type":"selector_exists","selector":"#<root-element-id>"},
    {"id":"console","type":"no_console_errors"},
    {"id":"asset","type":"asset_loads","path":"/tools/assets/<function>.js"} ] }
```

## Delivery mechanism
<Path 1 inline script -> /tools/assets/<function>.js | Path 2 js_snippet | build-time content> — and why

## Dependencies
<data feeds, assets, other components, scheduled tasks>

## Deliberate decisions — do not re-fix
<choices a later pass must not "fix">
$plan$, 'human', 'pilot');

-- 3) verify the fence is intact:
SELECT subject_key, is_current, body LIKE '%```criteria%' AS has_fence
FROM doc_plans WHERE subject_type='tool' AND is_current;
```

### Stage 4 — remaining wiring (same fetch-first pattern per agent)
Resolved agent types (from the live `agent_definitions` list):
- **`tool-generator` → PLAN at creation.** Needs a PLAN-body composition step
  before `write_doc_plan` (the action reads `doc_plan_body`): compose from
  material in hand (spec slice, delivery mechanism, deliberate decisions,
  initial criteria block). Then `rag_index` (`collection='tool_docs'`). Same
  hook later on **`component-creator`** for non-tool complex components.
- **Fix agents → `append_doc_note` as the LAST step:** `component-template-fixer`,
  `tool-improver`, and **`tool-recreation-handler`** (the recreation path;
  `update_component_html` is an ACTION, not an agent). 
- Fetch each definition (same A/B/C pattern), paste, migration drafted against
  the real JSON, targeting the current version row.

### Stage 5 — Tier-2 contract-presence check  ← DEFINITION
**A static, browserless verifier.** Loads the tool's `criteria_json` (same
query as `load_doc_context`) and asserts the **statically visible subset**
against the DEPLOYED artifacts — parse deployed page HTML for
`selector_exists`/`selector_count`; confirm `asset_loads`
(`/tools/assets/<function>.js` present); plus shell checks (`<no value>`,
empty schema, header not leaked). **Nothing executes** — cheap enough for
every sweep; catches markup-visible categories (`empty-shell`,
`detool-on-rebuild`, `js-not-extracted`, `broken-template-slots`).
`no_console_errors`, `interaction`, overflow remain Tier 4's job.
**Home:** a new pass inside `check_tool_health` — read `check_tool_health.go`
first to place it. Runs only when a current PLAN with criteria exists; a tool
without one gets a `needs_criteria` note, never a fake pass. **Failures →**
`improve_tool` item carrying the failing criterion (as `acceptance_test`) +
an `acceptance-fail` note. **Precondition:** ≥1 tool PLAN with criteria (the
pilot above, or Stage 4).

### Stage 6 — Runner P0  ← DEFINITION
**The smallest end-to-end slice of the Tier-4 headless runner.** One adapter
deployment (`browser-runner-adapter` in `ai-persona-system`; image = Chromium
+ Playwright, `playwright-go` consumer), two Kafka topics (analyser-adapter
request/response shape, Strimzi KafkaTopic CRs on `personae-kafka-cluster`),
implementing EXACTLY three check types, DESKTOP profile only (1366×900):
`page_status_ok`, `selector_exists`, `no_console_errors`.
Request `{run_id, urls, profiles:["desktop"], criteria_json, function,
site_id}` → Response `{run_id, results:[{check_id, profile, url, pass,
detail}]}` on the caller's response topic.
**Driven by a hand-produced request** against ONE known live tool page — no
agent workflow, no loop wiring, no mobile, no screenshots. **Exit test:**
results match manual inspection of that page. **Deliverables:**
Dockerfile/image, k8s Deployment, KafkaTopic CRs, consumer main.go, response
schema. Mobile, full interpreter, interactions, screenshots, and the
`tool-acceptance-agent` are P1–P3 (`PLAN_tool_acceptance_runner.md`).

---

## 1. Where the docs live

- **Truth (Postgres, LIVE):** `doc_plans` (current + history) and `doc_notes`
  (append-only), keyed `(subject_type, subject_key)`:
  `('tool', <function>)` byte-for-byte from `content_components.function`;
  `('pipeline', <one of: build | content | design | maintenance>)`.
- **Retrieval index (derived):** `knowledge_base` collections via `rag_index`;
  `rag_lookup` for discovery only. Never edited directly.
- **Mirror (optional, Phase B):** rendered markdown to a docs repo.

## 2. Writing / updating a PLAN

**Tools:** at first creation of a `function` (`create_tool_component`) and on
intent change — not on forks. Sections: Aim · Source spec · Behaviour contract →
**## Acceptance criteria** with a fenced block (schema v0 + check types:
`PLAN_tool_acceptance_runner.md`; skeleton: the pilot INSERT above). Multi-page
tools add Page set & inter-page contract. · Delivery mechanism + why ·
Dependencies · Deliberate decisions.

**Pipelines:** authored initially (distil 004–008); Aim · Invariants · Branch
rationale · Seams · Deliberate decisions. **Never embed the step map** — derive
from `agent_definitions`.

**How:** `write_doc_plan` (supersede tx; one current row enforced by
`idx_doc_plans_current`). Then `rag_index`. Rollback = restore a prior row.
`pinned=true` = human hold. Keep orchestration ids/dates out of the inline
`<script>` header (019) — provenance is columns.

## 3. Appending a NOTES entry

**When:** any fix (fix agent's **last step**); workflow-altering migrations
(pipeline note: number, what, why); acceptance runs; diagnosis runs (§4).
**How:** `append_doc_note` (one INSERT; body = the uniform entry; `site_id`
for per-site incidents).

**Taxonomy:** `css-variable-mismatch`, `empty-shell`/`mode-b-template`,
`broken-template-slots`, `content-vs-runtime-mismatch`, `detool-on-rebuild`,
`js-not-extracted`, `js-bundle-stale`, `schema-template-drift`, `diagnosis`,
`unconfirmed-diagnosis`, `migration`, `seam`, `acceptance-run`,
`acceptance-fail`, `truncated-output`, `needs_criteria`.

## 4. Persisting diagnosis output

`persist_diagnosis_note` runs **after** `diagnose_emit` (emit stays read-only).
Explicit subject in `input_data` only — **skip, don't guess**. CONFIRMED →
root-cause entry; UNVERIFIABLE → persisted tagged `unconfirmed-diagnosis` (dead
ends stop retries). `source='diagnosis-loop'`.

## 5. Tool acceptance & iteration

1. **Criteria live in the tool's PLAN** (fenced block; extracted by
   `load_doc_context` as `criteria_json`). Per-site parametrisation →
   `direction.must_have`, not the PLAN.
2. **Ladder:** Tier 0 generation-time (`HasToolDocHeader` +
   `check_tool_completeness`, flags-but-passes deliberately) → Tier 1
   structural (`check_tool_health`) → Tier 2 contract-presence (§0 Stage 5) →
   Tier 3 acceptance audit (`tool-auditor` vs criteria) → Tier 4 headless
   runner (§0 Stage 6).
3. **Iteration:** deploy → run → failing criterion → `improve_tool` item
   (criterion as `acceptance_test`, bounded by `max_fix_attempts`) → fixer
   loads PLAN+NOTES → fix → note → re-run. *Working* = criteria pass.
4. **Multi-page prerequisite:** preserve-sections re-render +
   interactivity-aware save guard (pending) before scaling page counts.

## 6. Loading context at fix time

`load_doc_context`: current PLAN + latest-N NOTES + `criteria_json`, composed
as one prompt-ready `doc_context` block. `has_plan=false` is a normal state.
For the code-diagnosis loop, hand `doc_context` in the way `runtime_evidence`
is handed to `diagnose_assemble_bundle`. `rag_lookup` for discovery. Read
**Deliberate decisions** before changing anything.

## 7. Verification

1. One current PLAN per subject (partial unique enforces).
2. Notes append with non-empty categories; diagnosis runs on an explicit
   subject leave a `diagnosis` entry; runs without one leave NO row.
3. Roll-up uses GIN: `SELECT subject_key, created_at FROM doc_notes WHERE
   categories ? 'detool-on-rebuild';`
4. `criteria_json` extracts from the PLAN (fence intact) and parses as JSON.
5. Acceptance: failures created `improve_tool` items carrying the criterion;
   passes left an `acceptance-run` note.
6. Inline header untouched: sentinel in `rendered_html`, stripped from shipped
   page + `/tools/assets/<function>.js`.
7. Pipeline topology claims: regenerate from `agent_definitions`.

0 rows is not decisive until the query itself is ruled out.

## 8. Gotchas

- Truth is Postgres, not git — never the home of an append.
- NOTES = one row per entry, never a shared file (RMW/lost-update).
- Skip, don't guess the diagnosis subject; a mis-filed note poisons history.
- `check_tool_completeness` **deliberately** lets flagged output through — wire
  a `truncated-output` note instead of "fixing" it.
- Tier 2 is static: never read a Tier-2 pass as "the tool works" — that claim
  belongs to Tier 4.
- Don't hand-draw pipeline topology; author invariants/rationale/seams only.
- Criteria describe the tool TYPE; site-specific expectations →
  `direction.must_have`.
- `rag_index` labels `source_type='scrape'` — parameterise if it matters.
- Workflows flat; complexity in Go; `logger.Info`; check schemas before SQL;
  pods `-n ai-persona-system`, Kafka `-n kafka`; deploys via GitHub → Actions →
  Backblaze.
