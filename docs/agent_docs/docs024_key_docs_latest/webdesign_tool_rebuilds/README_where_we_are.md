# Where we are — webdesign tool rebuilds

2026-08-15. The owner asked us to speed up replacing the 63 imported ("ported") tools on
webdesign.co.uk with tools the framework builds and manages itself. Today we found out how
native tools actually get built (a suggester files a work item, a generator builds it), and
discovered nothing was replacing the imported ones — the generator was only adding new tools.
We also cleaned up two hazards first: a shared template that a fixer bot had overwritten with
the wrong tool's markup (restored; nothing had broken yet), and the one page where a native
tool had been dropped next to its imported twin, showing both a leftover and a raw template
tag to visitors (repair queued, leftover retired).

The plan: prove the replacement recipe on one simple tool (the aspect-ratio calculator — its
rebuild is queued), then work through the simple tools one at a time. The rich, hand-built
apps (mind-map studio, meme studio, mini-CMS and friends) are deliberately excluded — an
AI rebuild from a one-line description would quietly lose what makes them good; they wait for
the faithful-conversion route or a per-tool decision.
