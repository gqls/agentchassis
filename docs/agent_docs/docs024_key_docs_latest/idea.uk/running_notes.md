# Running notes — in-chat ideas, reasoning, and suggestions

**Purpose:** capture the reasoning, suggestions, caveats, and choice-points
surfaced in chat that aren't fully recorded in the formal docs (plans, FOCUS,
method, test runs). Living journal; appended each turn going forward.

**Conventions:**
- Chronological. One section per session/day; entries within are brief.
- Each entry names the topic, the idea/reasoning, what got chosen (if anything),
  and which formal doc it landed in (or "kept here only").
- *Suggested but not pursued* items are flagged — they may be worth revisiting.
- *Caveats* are flagged separately because they're easy to lose.
- "Standing observations" at the end holds cross-cutting principles.
- "Open threads" tracks what's in flight at the end of the session.

## 2026-05-27 — session arc (backfilled)

### Chatbot framing: serving is the new piece, not bounded context or recording
The chat question decomposed into three parts with very different reuse stories:
bounded context (reuse the existing RAG/`knowledge_base` and `site_specs`);
recording each turn (one new table; deliberately separate from the build-time
`llm_call_log` for retention/PII reasons); serving (the genuinely new bit,
blocked because Layer 2 doesn't exist).
**Doc:** `FOCUS_site_chatbot_edge_worker_and_context_pack.md`.

### Option A vs B for the runtime turn
Suggested A (synchronous edge worker) over B (Kafka-orchestrated agent) because
B can't stream tokens to the browser and inherits the chassis's async failure
modes (offset replay, OOM cascades, 10-min retry timeouts). The Kafka fabric is
right for durable build work, wrong for live request/response. **Caveat:** if a
spawned-per-turn agent is used, the platform's own ~12s `DefaultRemoteStartupWait`
makes it a non-starter regardless. **Doc:** FOCUS §2.

### Serverless edge vs central nginx VM (security)
Read the sister `terraform-nginx-reverse-proxy` project and found concrete
weaknesses: SSH password auth, secrets marked `sensitive = false`, exposed
Grafana/Prometheus, merge-conflict markers in `main.tf` (config drift). The
central VM model would also drag static content behind the box (DNS leaves S3),
so it loses the hack-resistance we like about S3. **Suggested:** serverless edge
worker, provider-agnostic via a thin shim. **Doc:** FOCUS §3 + Appendix A.

### Phase 4 long pole is routing, not the router code
The harder structural problem in standing up Layer 2 isn't the Go service — it's
that `/api/*` on a static-S3 domain needs a proxy/edge in front that splits
static from API. Most likely thing to be underestimated. Flagged early.
**Doc:** discussed in chat; the eventual serverless route bypassed this.

### Isolated chat environment — three vectors
Reframed isolation into load, hack, and bug as separable concerns. Crucial
correction surfaced in chat: **live traffic already never hits the cluster** (it
hits the edge worker), so isolation is about turn data, drain/analytics, and any
chat workflow code — not the request path. **Doc:** `PLAN_isolated_chat_environment.md`
§§1–2.

### Don't reuse Phase 4a multi-cluster — it's a *coupling* mechanism
The existing `va001` multi-cluster pattern shares Kafka and Postgres on purpose;
that's the inverse of isolation. Reuse the chassis binaries, action code, and B2
storage pattern, but not the shared-Kafka dispatch. **Doc:** §3 of isolation plan.

### Self-correction: ownership already exists (not "net-new identity layer")
Initially called the identity/ownership layer "net-new." Reading the schema
showed `clients → networks → sites` already exists, with `clients.external_id`
as a back-reference to external identity/billing. Corrected.
**Doc:** isolation plan §13 (corrected subsection).

### Self-correction (twice): billing is scaffolded, not "largely exists"
First turn after reading the auth Go *models* I said "billing mostly exists."
After reading `subscription/{service,repository,handlers}.go` it had to be
corrected again: no Stripe SDK, no webhook handler, `CreateSubscription` stamps
`status=active` with no payment, `GetUsageStats` returns mock zeros, and the
repository mixes `?` and `$1` placeholders (never run on one DB). **Caveat
for future:** model-first reads can mislead; verify against implementation.
**Doc:** `PLAN_stripe_billing_integration.md` §1 + corrected §13 of isolation plan.

### Build-as-a-service example reframes the satellite
Working through "type a domain, get a site" via the chatbot on design.co.uk
showed the satellite isn't a chat box — it's a customer-facing instance of the
whole platform. Strongest justification yet for full chassis. "Hybrid S3 +
lambdas" *is* the edge pattern. Two `sites` populations (core = portfolio;
satellite = customer SaaS), not a stale copy. **Doc:** isolation plan §12.

### Commercial model resolved: operator-primary, vendor-optional
Operating thousands of domains ≠ thousands of clusters. Isolate at the
*satellite*; partition for sale at the *domain*. Per-domain sell-on = re-parent
`site.network_id` + swap credentials. Pluggable billing = adapter discipline
same as everything else. **Doc:** isolation plan §13.

### Pivot to simple paid multi-domain chat — the real cost question
Surfaced the reframe: legitimate inference on a cheap model is fractions of a
cent; the cost drivers are abuse + model choice, not honest usage. So
"can't afford free" may be overstated; free-with-tight-caps could be affordable.
Charging the visitor is also the *expensive* path because card processing has a
fixed per-transaction fee that punishes sub-£5 charges. **Doc:** `PLAN_simple_paid_multidomain_chat.md` §3.

### Per-domain monetisation by domain type
Suggested split: chat-is-the-product domains (visitor pays) vs business-chasing-
leads domains (free + capture). Same worker, different mode flag. Resolved for
the first batch: chat-is-the-product, day-pass. **Doc:** §5.

### Day-pass collapses payment complexity
A time-pass token is stateless and validates by signature + expiry — no edge KV,
no decrement, no webhook on the critical path. Issue via a synchronous
`/redeem` endpoint against the payment provider. Counted credits would need
edge state; only worth it if a pass doesn't fit. **Doc:** §6.

### The differentiator framework
The AI model isn't the differentiator; the asset it's applied to is. A payable
idea = asset × AI × audience-that-pays. Five asset types: proprietary data,
owned process/output, well-built tool, partnership, early-mover timing on a new
capability. Maintain two menus (assets, current capabilities) and cross them.
**Doc:** §10.

### The reusability trap
Bespoke tools don't carry across unrelated domains the way grounding does, so
"many domains each with a payable tool" is many separate builds. *Suggested
shape:* one or two reusable differentiators + a few high-value single domains;
avoid the bespoke-tool-for-one-mid-value-domain combination. **Doc:** §10.

### idea.uk: internal-first, sale-ready, recursive
Suggested treating idea.uk as one configured paid-chat domain whose tool *is*
the ideation method. Internal version uses our assets; hosted version uses the
user's. Keep assets as input data (so the same method serves both). Also keep
the workflows/actions it uses identifiable and minimal so it can be sold as a
working site. Dogfood: run the method on idea.uk itself. **Doc:** `PLAN_idea_uk.md`.

### Moat analysis (idea.uk)
Search grounding isn't a moat. Reproducible by a determined prompter:
decomposition, verification. Harder to reproduce: a maintained capability
watchlist that beats the model's self-knowledge (the early-adopter mechanism),
multi-model ensemble with cross-critique, evidence-attached verification,
accumulated memory, and the build bridge (we can prototype the idea, not just
describe it). Honest verdict: this is an effort/freshness/integration moat
sustained by maintenance, not a static asset. **Doc:** §5 of idea.uk plan.

### Capability watchlist warrants its own workflow
Suggested that maintaining the watchlist isn't ad-hoc — it's a recurring
research workflow whose output (new entries) triggers a re-run of ideation
across domains. That re-run loop *is* the early-adopter mechanism. **Doc:** §8
of idea.uk plan.

### Method test run — the critique step changed the answer
First pass scored the websitedesign "spec-as-starter-prompt" idea 15/test-now.
Critique pass against the *real* free substitute (describe it to Bolt yourself,
plus Bolt's own planning step) dropped willingness-to-pay to 2 → **failed the
gate**. Adding durability also flagged it as eroding fast. The version that
survives is an orchestration layer (spec + run + critique + iterate), which is
expensive — consider, not test-now. **Single-pass would have built a weak
product.** **Doc:** `idea_uk_testrun_v0.md` (revised).

### Method v1 changes derived from the test
Two improvements went into the method: (a) Durability factor in the rubric, 1–5
on how much base-model improvement erodes the idea; ≤2 flagged as short-lived.
(b) Cut step must name the *specific* free substitute, not test against "free AI"
in the abstract. **Doc:** `idea_uk_method_v0.md` (now effectively v1).

### Multi-model critique caveat
The critique pass above was a rigorous opposing pass by the *same* model, not a
genuinely different model. The real tool should use a different provider here;
that would likely catch more. Honest limit of the test, not a hidden flaw.
**Kept here only** (also in test-run verdict).

## Standing observations (cross-cutting)

- **Reuse before rebuild.** Said many times; concrete cases this session:
  `clients→networks→sites` hierarchy, `approval_mode` hold for the build gate,
  heartbeat selection queries for the maintenance gate, chassis binaries + action
  code on the satellite, JWT carrying `client_id` + `tier`.
- **Verify against implementation, not models.** The billing reframe (twice)
  taught this; scaffolds can imply working systems that aren't there.
- **Live traffic never reaches the cluster in any of the chat designs.** The
  edge worker is the surface; everything cluster-side is async/post-hoc.
- **The fixed per-transaction fee is the real micro-payment constraint**, not
  inference cost. Pushes bundles to a few pounds, not pennies.
- **The reusability axis is what stops bespoke-tool-per-domain becoming a trap.**
- **Separability is a saleability property as well as a blast-radius one.** Same
  discipline applies in two different places (cluster level, domain level,
  workflows-and-actions level for idea.uk).
- **A single generative pass can send you to build a weak product.** The
  test-run is direct evidence; the critique step is not decoration.

---

## Open threads (end of session)

- **Method v1 work outstanding:** willingness-to-pay still estimated; multi-model
  critique should be run with a genuinely different model when the tool exists.
- **Next-step options I offered, not yet chosen:**
  - Build the fake-door demand test for the *orchestration-layer* version of the
    websitedesign idea (1b), not the bare prompt (1a) which the critique failed.
  - Run the method against a third domain with a *data-asset* candidate (e.g.
    gaswholesalers' "buy a proprietary feed") to test the verification step on a
    different asset type.
- **PLAN_stripe_billing_integration.md** is settled but gated on the auth DB
  engine question; not yet started.
- **PLAN_isolated_chat_environment.md** open decisions: X vs Y satellite shape;
  capability classes for chat; turn sink (queue vs D1); pack storage location.
- **Capability list in the method** is a starter; the watchlist workflow itself
  isn't designed.
