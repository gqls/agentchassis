This implementation provides:

Automatic Topic Creation: When you create a new agent definition via the API, it automatically creates all necessary Kafka topics
Startup Initialization: On Core Manager startup, it ensures all system topics exist and creates topics for any existing agents
Topic Verification: API endpoint to check if all topics exist for a given agent
Manual Recreation: API endpoint to manually trigger topic creation if needed
Async Processing: Topic creation happens asynchronously with retries to avoid blocking the API
Notifications: System events are sent when topics are created or if creation fails

The topics created for each agent include:

system.agent.{type}.process - Main processing topic
system.responses.{type} - Response topic
system.errors.{type} - Error handling
dlq.{type} - Dead letter queue
Priority queues for data-driven agents (tasks.high.{type}, etc.)
Adapter topics for adapter agents

This solution keeps everything within Core Manager, uses your existing Kafka connection, and automatically manages the infrastructure as agents are created.
